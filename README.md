# Bootstrap

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

## How to make Bootstrap project 

1. npm install -g @angular/cli (This will install Angular CLI commandlet at global space)
2. ng new mynewapplication (mynewapplication is just application name. ng is the Angular CLI command with new is argument to create new application/project. Like 'new' there are other command arguments also available, like 'generate', 'serve', 'test', 'lint', 'format')
3. cd mynewapplication (After previous command new folder will be created as 'mynewapplication').
4. npm install (Since there will be a file package.json, which will keep all dependencies. The above command will install all dependencies with this command)
5. ng serve (Agular using HTTP as service, so by calling 'serve' command with '-o/-open' will serve the page in new browser window/tab. By default 4200 port will be used to serve).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build
